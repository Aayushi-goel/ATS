# 📄 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Project

## Overview

This project is an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** that allows users to upload resumes in PDF format, analyze them using Google Generative AI, and compare them with job descriptions. The system provides insights and evaluations based on the uploaded resume's content, including a percentage match against the job description.

## 🚀 Features

- **📤 Resume Upload and Conversion:** Upload a resume in PDF format, which is then converted to an image for processing.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini model) to evaluate resumes against job descriptions.
- **🖥️ Interactive User Interface:** Built using Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization of results.
- **🔐 Environment Variable Management:** Securely handles API keys and other sensitive information using Python-Dotenv.
